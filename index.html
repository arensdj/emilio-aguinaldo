        <h3>Here's a timeline of Emilio Aguinaldo's life:</h3>
        <ul>
        <li><span>1869</span> - Born March 23 in Kawit, Philippines. Aguinaldo was the seventh of eight children. Emilio was named after St. Emilio, which means holy.  His parents were of Chinese and Tagalog descent.</li>
        <li><span>Childhood</span> - Emilio was given a good education with his primary education centered on catechism.  He also learned arithmetic and the Spanish language and studied Doctrina Cristiana, El Amigo de los Ninos and Cuatro Reglas Principales.</li>
        <li><span>1883</span> - When Aguinaldo was just nine years old, his father died and Emilio was forced to stop school.  He returned home to Kawit in order to help his mother in their sugar factory, and later on, in fishing.
        <li><span>1895</span> - He developed a growing awareness of Filipino frustration with Spanish colonial rule.  While serving as the head of barter in Manila, he joined the Pilar Lodge chapter of the Freemasonry.  The Freemasonry was a government- and church-banned resistance group.  It was through his role as municipal captain of this fraternity that Aguinaldo met Andres Bonifacio, a key figure in the fight to overthrow Spanish rule.  Aguinaldo was inducted by fellow anti-colonialist Andres Bonifacio into the underground Katipunan movement.  This organization was committed to the removal of Spanish colonialism, even if it meant accomplishing that goal by armed rebellion. 
        <li><span>1896 Philippine Revolution</span> - When a rival faction executed Bonifacio in 1897, Aguinaldo assumed total leadership of the revolution against Spain.  They emerged into open rebellion following the execution of vocal pro-independence activist Jose Rizal by the Spanish. 
        <li><span>1896</span> - Aguinaldo met and married Hilaria, his first wife, during this period.  They had five children: Carmen Aguinaldo-Melencio, Emilio "Jun" R. Aguinaldo Jr., Maria Aguinaldo-Poblete, Cristina Aguinaldo-Suntay, and Miguel Aguinaldo. </li> 
        <li><span>1897</span> - Aguinaldo had managed to reach the Truce of Biak-na-Bato with Spain. He and his rebels agreed to a surrendering of arms and accepted exile to Hong Kong in exchange for amnesty, indemnity and liberal reform. However, neither side kept up their end of the bargain. Aguinaldo's revolutionaries used some of Spain's financial compensation to purchase additional arms for the resistance.  From Hong Kong, Aguinaldo also made arrangements to assist Americans fighting against Spain in the Spanish-American War. 
        <li><span>1898 Spanish-American War</span> - As neither peace nor independence had been achieved, Aguinaldo returned to the Philippines to resume his rebellion against Spanish rule. On June 12 Aguinaldo at last declared Philippine independence.  Announced from his hometown of Kawit, Aguinaldo's proclamation put an end to four centuries of Philippine oppression under Spanish Colonial rule.  
        <li><span>1899</span> - Dressed in a white suit at Barasoain Church in Malolos City, Aguinaldo was sworn in as the first president of the new, self-governed Philippine republic.
        <li><span>1899 Philippine-American War</span> - Just two weeks after Aguinaldo's inauguration, an American sentry killed a Philippine soldier stationed at the San Juan Bridge, in a gesture of resistance against the newfound Philippine independence. On February 4 the Philippine-American War exploded into action. Aguinaldo led the Philippine-American War against U.S. resistance to Philippine independence.  Aguinaldo's revolutionaries quickly resorted to guerilla tactics, resulting in one of the bloodiest wars in American history. 
        <li><span>1901</span> - Aguinaldo was captured by American General Frederick Funston on March 23. After swearing an oath of allegiance to the United States, on April 19, Aguinaldo officially declared peace with the United States. By this time, the United States was ready to support limited Philippine independence.
          <li><span>1930</span> - Nine years after his first wife passed, Emilio remarried to Maria Agoncillo.
        <li><span>1964</span> - Emilio Aguinaldo died of a heart attack at Veterans Memorial Hospital in Quezon City, Philippines, on February 6, at the age of 94. His private land and mansion, which he had donated the prior year, continue to serve as a shrine to both the revolution for Philippine independence and the revolutionary himself.
